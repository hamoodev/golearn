## Just some machine learning code to learn GoLand

### Why ml code tho?
I made a webserver with all the CURD (CRUD??) operations.. just was not enough. I am doing my honours research in deep learning, so might as well have a refresh course on basic ml with goland by making stuff from scratch.. cuz using frameworks like pytorch makes me forget the basics

### TODO

- [x] Single Linear Regression (made it before the multi and forgor to save it, you can still do  single lg with multi)
- [x] Multi Linear Regression
- [ ] Logitic Regression (Classification)
- [ ] Nearest Neighbore (Classification)
- [ ] Neural Network (no way I am gonna do that, here for hopes and prayers)

Make this a package? idk
